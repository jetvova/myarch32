# Arithmetic Logic Unit

In order to perform mathematical operations, the CPU will contain an Arithmetic Logic Unit, a special type of circuit to which all registers are connected. 

On the rising edge of a CPU clock tick, two registers will be read, and the ALU will perform a calculation using them. When the falling edge arrives, the result of the calculation will be stored in a target register.
